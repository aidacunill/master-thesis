# master-thesis
This repository contains the Python code developed as part of my Master's thesis, **"Phase-Locking Dynamics in Oscillator Models with Inhibitory Inputs"**. The project explores the effect of excitatory and inhibitory periodic inputs on neural oscillators, with a focus on the communication-through-coherence (CTC) framework.

## Introduction

This project aims to:
- Analyze phase-locking behavior in neural oscillators.
- Implement numerical methods for Poincar√© maps and Arnold tongue visualizations.
- Evaluate the impact of different periodic inputs on communication dynamics.

The repository includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the experiments described in the thesis.

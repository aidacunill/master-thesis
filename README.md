# master-thesis
This repository contains the Python code developed as part of my Master's thesis, **"Phase-Locking Dynamics in Oscillator Models with Inhibitory Inputs"**. The project explores the effect of excitatory and inhibitory periodic inputs on neural oscillators, with a focus on the communication-through-coherence (CTC) framework.

## Introduction

This project aims to:
- Analyze phase-locking behavior in neural oscillators.
- Implement numerical methods for Poincar√© maps and Arnold tongue visualizations.
- Evaluate the impact of different periodic inputs on communication dynamics.

The repository includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the experiments described in the thesis.

## Files

- "STROBOSCOPIC_MAP_EI": Python code for computing the Arnold Tongues and CTC measures for the E-I system with a single excitatory input. It also includes the calculation of Vector Strength when an inhibitory input is added.
- "STROBOSCOPIC_MAP_EII": Python code for computing the Arnold Tongues and CTC measures for the E-I-I system with one excitatory input.
- "STROBOSCOPIC_MAP_p(t)negative": Python code for computing the Arnold Tongues and CTC measures for the E-I system with one inhibitory input.
- "STROBOSCOPIC_MAP_EI_inh": Python code for computing the Arnold Tongues and CTC measures for the E-I system with both excitatory and inhibitory inputs.
